# Intune Remediations

The **Intune Remediations** collection is a set of script packages designed to detect and fix common support issues on user endpoints. Each script package includes a detection script, a remediation script, and metadata. By deploying these packages through Intune, you can proactively address issues before end-users even notice them, potentially reducing support calls.
